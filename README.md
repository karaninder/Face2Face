# Face2Face
A software which takes images of two people and can takes the expressions of person in 1st photo and mimics the same expression in the 2nd image.
We will provide a dataset to the machine so that the machine learns to distinguish between different expressions. 
In this software the machine learns from the facial landmarks and translates onto a face model. 
Here we will provide the machine with 2 images of two different people with different expressions, the machine will apply various 
algorithms to identify the facial expression on image 1 and depict the same expression on the face of the person in image 2. 
The same is used to create a video of the expression.

Tools/ Technologies used to build this software are:

1.Anaconda / Python 3.5
2.TensorFlow 1.2
3.OpenCV 3.0
4.Dlib 19.4
